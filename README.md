# little-react

:construction: Work In Progres :construction:

This is my own implementation of [React Lib](https://github.com/facebook/react/) for educational purposes. I tried to follow the same terminology that react core uses in their source code, to facilitate my understanding when navigating in their files.

## Features

This is a naive and simple implementation, so you shouldn't expect complex features, here's what we have support:

- Function Components
- Host Components
- Reconciliation
- Fiber

## Getting into it

1. Install npm
2. Clone the repo
3. Run `npm start` (changes in src/index.js will auto refresh your page)
